# Inspect-Elements
Backend Engine for optical charachter recognition and response against food ingredients


### Prolougue üóø 
The project revolves around getting good, clean insights on the ingredient labels on processed food items, 
Say Flavor Enhancer 635, found on a packet of Maggi, a general consumer cannot understand what it exactly means,
Having a guide who understands the same and explains that it is a common and essential food additive, its features are
how it will affect one person, and what quantity is allowed for a person. 

### Architecture üèπ 
Inspect Elements has two modules planned: an optical character recognition module and a Dataset accumulation.
Each will work hand in hand to give out responses.
