# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Inspect-Elements, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Privately Disclose**: Please do not publicly disclose the issue until it has been addressed by the maintainers.

2. **Contact Us**: Send an email to [ danwand47@gmail.com ] with details of the vulnerability.
   
3. **Provide Information**: Include a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it if possible. We appreciate any additional context you can provide.

4. **Response**: We will acknowledge your report within a eeek and work to address the issue promptly.

5. **Public Disclosure**: Once the issue is resolved, we will coordinate with you on a public disclosure if necessary.

## Supported Versions

At this stage, our open-source application is actively under development, and we are committed to maintaining security best practices throughout the development process. While we may not have specific released versions yet, here's how we approach security:

- **Development Focus**: Our primary focus is on ensuring the security of the latest development version of the application.

- **Continuous Security Assessment**: We regularly assess the codebase for security vulnerabilities and apply patches and fixes promptly.

- **Security Collaboration**: We encourage contributors and the community to report security-related issues, even during development. Your feedback is valuable in making our application more secure.

- **Future Release Plans**: As we progress, we plan to establish version releases. Once we have stable releases, we will update this section to specify which versions are supported with security updates.

## Security Updates

Security is a top priority for our open-source project. Here's how we handle security updates:

- **Proactive Monitoring**: We proactively monitor the codebase for security vulnerabilities. This includes regular code reviews, automated security scans, and threat modeling.

- **Timely Patching**: When a security vulnerability is identified, we take immediate action to address it. This may involve patching the code, updating dependencies, or implementing other security measures.

- **Communication**: We believe in transparent communication. When a security update is applied, we will notify the community through our communication channels, such as our website, mailing lists, or release notes.

- **Coordinated Disclosure**: If a security vulnerability is reported to us, we follow a coordinated disclosure process. We work with the reporter to validate the issue, develop a fix, and release the update. We greatly appreciate responsible disclosure from security researchers and the community
